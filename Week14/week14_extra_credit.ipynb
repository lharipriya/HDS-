Find out what it thinks about your idea and if it has any data sources (URLs for specific sites) that could be helpful.  Below, either include copy/paste the chat history from your conversation or include a link to the shared chat.

It's the up-arrow icon in the upper-right corner of your chat window.)\n",

        "Where it fell slightly short was in guaranteeing that all suggested URLs would lead directly to the described datasets. As noted, verifying the links would be important since ChatGPT can sometimes suggest plausible but incorrect links. Additionally, while it offered a high-level overview of machine learning techniques, providing a more in-depth explanation or detailed code snippets upfront would have been helpful.\n",
